- practiced with deploying an ethereum project to the rinkeby test network with infura io
- got exposed to nextjs, a wrapper around react that makes moving from pages easier

18 mar 2021
- got exposure to factory vs. primary interaction in front end
- got exposure to more nextjs, react, semantic-ui-react for front end dev
- read @lightclients's write-up on EIP-3074, which looks to decrease ETH cost by batching of sorts, allowing for a trusted "invoker"

- 9.3 panic vs Result... build error checks into structs
- 10.1 generics in structs, enums, methods

27 mar 2021
- created a minute pull request on substrate doc :-)
- watched [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4LFMcMSJVc) with dan shields.  lovely overview of the sales pitch for using substrate (modular and inter-operable chain-building
- watched [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47mL30nePLU) with dan forbes.  great for the community of web3/polkadot/multi-chain/decentralized life, particular with regards to community governance
- second run-through of [add a pallet to your runtime](https://substrate.dev/docs/en/tutorials/add-a-pallet/) tutorial for nicks pallet, played some
- first run-through of [build a poe decentralized application](https://substrate.dev/docs/en/tutorials/build-a-dapp/) tutorial for "owning" files.  really pretty awesome to see.


TODOs:
- keep with some PRs for docs if they keep getting approved :-)
- keep up on discord chat for substrate doc
- keep up on discord chat for microNFT project
- keep reviewing stack overflow for substrate
- keep trudging through rust book and reiterating practice
- keep going through substrate tutorials
- check out substrate recipes
